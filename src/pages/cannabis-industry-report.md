    subtitle: Cannabis Regulatory Impacts on Business Operations
    content: "### Abstract\n\nBy conducting one-on-one interviews with cannabis industry executives in a sample of five recreational states, we are able to obtain a qualitative understanding of the consequences of state regulatory compliance on operations and growth. Interviews included the full range of license types, from Producer to Retail, in order to understand the implications of compliance for each stage in the cannabinoid product lifecycle. To balance the perspective of industry interviewees, we included interviews with state regulators in Washington and Oregon.\n\nThe most salient of issues consistently communicated by business operators related to banking and access to commercial financing. The interviews further indicate the regulated cannabis market -- both in terms of product liquidity and inventory prices -- is distorted due to state regulatory policies.\_ We conclude our work with a summary of the trajectory of markets as anticipated by industry participants, followed by commentary on the implications from our interviews. We observe that compliance with state regulations is hampering growth and, most importantly, the supply-price efficiencies expected in open free markets.\n"

  - title: Research Objectives
    content: "Our objective was to seek a broad, industry-wide examination of cannabis participants because far too often states are treated independently. Indeed, the most accurate reports available on the cannabis industry are often published by state regulatory boards themselves in order to meet legislative mandates. These reports are therefore solely focused on a single state. Indeed, most state-produced research on the cannabis industry does not focus on the business consequences for operators due to regulations. Instead, state policy researchers focus on either macro-economic factors such as raw THC produced or canopy grown with future forecasts. In other instances, researchers focus on addressing public health or social perception changes.\_\n\nWhile a state-centric perspective is appropriate for many examinations due to the patchwork of legalized markets across the US, this technique fragments the potential of examining the meta-trends within the cannabis industry. This lack of focus on the economic and financial consequences presents a clear gap in current research.\_\n\nWithout exception, cannabinoid products are among the most heavily regulated and taxed consumer products available in the US. This implies that business owners and operators are experiencing real costs associated with compliance. What are they?\n\nWe attempt to answer this with a motivating interview question: \"How does compliance with state regulations impact business operations and growth?\"\n\n## Methods\n\nBecause each point in the lifecycle of a cannabinoid product (\"seed to sale\") is tracked by all states, we did not limit our examination to a particular license type. Instead, we sought the perspective of established businesses at each stage.\_\n\nIn order to obtain first-hand information from business operators, we conducted one-on-one interviews with established cannabinoid operators. These interviews were unsolicited -- we conducted direct outreach seeking individuals who were managing business operations and willing to participate in the research.\_ Of 100 businesses contacted, we obtained 12 partial interviews and 16 complete interviews. While our hope was for a minimum of 30 *completed* interviews, we felt the data collected thus far were still significant and worth sharing before any insights grew stale.\n\nBecause our examination sought to understand the trends and trajectories for markets, we attempted to select states at varying stages of maturity. Maturity in this context is tied to the development of the regulated market, rather than the illicit market ecosystem. Attempting to gauge the maturity of an unregulated market's ecosystem (production, distribution, consumption) would be a quixotic task as little data are available and market participants are not directly identifiable. While we concede that an existing illicit market likely contributes to the trajectory of a regulated market's development, this is an unknowable quantity. Moreover, the state's legal regulations directly shape the legalized consumer market's development as it is through the regulated market processes that direct retail activity is possible. In our opinion, the legislated regulations are strict enough to make the existence of the unregulated market's operational efficiency a moot point -- legal operators *cannot* function in a similar way as illicit operators, so it is a matter of comparing apples to robots.\_ What is *measurable* in this context is *the experience of the legal operator since inception*.\_\n\nWe view a state’s existing *medical* cannabis program in a similar light. That is, the transition effects from an existing Medical Cannabis program were excluded on the basis that the medical program existed in each state *prior* to recreational status, thereby acting as a *loose* control condition among all participating states. We cannot construct a laboratory with exactly controlled pre-recreational states, though we can evaluate the *recreational* status as similar enough to act as an acceptable control among the states.\_\_\n\nTo establish a baseline understanding of the nation-wide trends in cannabis at varying degrees of market maturity, we selected key markets for examination: CA, CO, OR, MA, WA.\n"

  - title: Top Compliance Impacts to Business Operations
    content: "The consistent theme regarding direct costs, be that cannabis product testing, plant tagging, harvest tracking, or simple CTS data entry, is that they are largely resolvable with an employee hire. This was a surprising finding as we speculated that operational demands would be considered heavy even in light of employee hires. While our objective was to find the direct consequences of compliance on operations, our interviews revealed that the *indirect effects of existing regulations were more salient for businesses* than the direct. The following sections summarizes these salient issues expressed by interviewees in order of relative salience to the interviewees.\n\n### Banking and Financing\n\nEach operator in some form brought up banking or commercial financing, without exception. This problem, originating exclusively on the federal level, remains the bugbear for the industry with multiple secondary consequences.\_\_\n\nWhile state regulators expressed a direct interest in attempting to help cannabis operators, there is only so much a state government can do in light of federal regulations regarding cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance. This is likely no surprise to any reader. As it stands, banking services for any cannabis related business are generally restricted to in-state credit unions. Banking services for multi-state operators (MSOs) remain exceptionally rare and reserved for the largest and well-funded enterprises, often publicly traded operations.\n\nDespite the status of banking, interviews with state regulators in WA and OR indicate *satisfaction with the trajectory of banking* penetration among cannabis operators. WA cited 99% of taxes collected come in the form of a check, a strong leading indication of business banking services. Operators, however, see the situation as expensive with monthly banking services a noticeable line-item, especially compared to the range of banking services offered to them versus traditional commercial banking options (cash deposits, transfers, payroll). This trend was not as noticeable regarding insurance costs, as no cannabis operators expressed insurance as onerous.\n\nBeyond expensive basic banking services, obtaining financing opportunities remains an extremely salient challenge for business operators, particularly due to the lack of acceptance of cannabis as an equal-risk operation to other legal manufacturing, wholesale or retail operations. Banks simply restrict or outright deny access to traditional commercial lending such as obtaining lines of credit against equipment or real estate. We explore potential consequences of this structure in our commentary, “Market Distortions.”\_\n\n### Brand Differentiation\n\nMultiple operators, from production to retail, expressed an interest in brand development. From their perspective, cannabis is competitive regardless of which segment of the industry one operates in and that long-term brand differentiation will be needed to sustain future growth. We summarize below, by operator type, the expressed obstacles to brand development.\_\n\nFor retailers, concerns focused on consumer access to products including how regulations impacted customer experience or inadvertently perpetuated negative social stigmas. An example of perpetuating social stigma is rules pertaining to product accessibility: cannabinoid products cannot be viewable from public spaces, resulting in boarded up windows, typically a sign of antisocial behavior. This later problem is tightly coupled to zoning restrictions (below), though is also impacted by state-mandated licencing constraints.\_\n\nIn the case of production operations, their ability to develop a deep customer relationship (\"brand\") is severely constrained by the total canopy of production. That is, a single grow operation which may feel it has a competitively advantaged product (\"flower\", “genetics”), cannot supply enough dispensaries to develop the penetration needed to build a consistent supply that can translate into a *Brand*. That is, the supply constraint prevents the retail penetration necessary for a consumer recognition of a grow-operation. As explored further in “Market Distortions” (below), the value of cannabinoid products in any form are directly tied to the artificial supply constraints imposed by canopy licensing limits. Licensing and premise requirements (security, facilities, etc) perpetuate the cost-skew.\n\nWere those canopy limits or facility constraints removed, the per-unit cost of a cannabinoid product would demonstrably drop. We speculate that while production operations would then be positioned *hypothetically* to expand operations sufficiently to develop consistent market penetration which *may* result in consumer brand awareness, we feel it is *more likely* that cannabis would rapidly come into alignment with other farming commodities: less branding on base products and more on refined or finished goods. In that scenario, the processing and edibles operators would be better positioned for long-term brand development, as would retail locations focused on a differentiated consumer experience, such as seen with Starbucks or McDonalds compared to generic coffee or burger operations.\n\nFor processing companies, the obstacles were generally restricted to typical product-differentiation needs: proper penetration into retail spaces and reliable supply lines. These are, in effect, issues regarding capitalization and operational scale. Regulatory compliance was not characterized as impactful on brand development.\_\_\n\nThe exception to this desire for brand development was with the Wholesale and Logistics licenses due to their B2B focus. However, multiple wholesale operators expressed their service differentiation as a close collaboration with producers and processors in developing *their* brands. The wholesale operators included in our interviews expressed prior experience in logistics that they leveraged into the cannabis trade. Many participants expressed this experience provided them the proper perspective on cannabis as a *commodity*, a perspective in the opinion of the interviewees that is not frequently shared by other license holders such as dispensaries and producers. Indeed, many of the wholesale operators expressed auxiliary business services focused within industry and operational consulting as a primary value proposition for producers and processors. In this way, the wholesalers frequently positioned themselves in our discussions as business partners for producers and processors in which all businesses’ success have a soft dependency on one another. That is, each company’s growth is intertwined with the others. Examples include a need for coordinating pricing, guidance on packaging and the maintenance of relationships with dispensaries.\_\_\_\n\n### Regulatory Delay\n\nOverarching many discussions, interviewees highlighted the delays their businesses experienced in navigating regulatory compliance. Be it in Colorado, Oregon or Massachusetts, participants were most impressed by the lengthy process initial set up required. Some participants were looking to expand but were hampered by the application and zoning requirements. In Oregon and Washington, applications for new cannaprenueres have been effectively turned off. Washington, at the time of writing, has no plans to lift the application mortuarium. Oregon only recently (April 2021) began re-evaluating applications which were submitted prior to a state legislative moratorium that went into effect in 2018. *Three years of delay*. These are only the largest, most salient of delays for operators.\_\n\nInterviewees also expressed frustration with local municipalities, particularly in the earliest days of recreational authorization. One interviewee explained the situation as a result of local governmental officials (city, county) who are navigating the new legislation on the state- and city-levels at the same time the entrepreneurs who are attempting to launch their businesses. This results in local officials being poorly equipped from an *experiential* level -- they simply do not know how to properly implement the state, count and city ordinances. That lack of domain experience directly impacts the entrepreneurs.\n\nClearly the *costs* to the business and entrepreneur due to regulatory delay are salient and quantifiable. In the case of a producer seeking to expand canopy, she applies for another license *after* securing the land, *after* designing and constructing regulation-compliance infrastructure (facilities, security, etc), and *after* establishing insurance, water rights and more. The cost of a three-year delay in this case is the cost of the land, property taxes, insurance for *three years*.\_\n\nInterviewees did not express a perspective that this situation would change, particularly in challenging states such as California. We believe this is among the most salient impacts on the development of the cannabis market as a whole and explore the consequences further in our commentary, “Market Distortions”.\n\n### Zoning\n\nDue to state legislative structuring, many local municipalities possess direct discretion over cannabis production, processing and retail within their jurisdictions. Likely also not a surprise for any reader, the interaction effects from state licensing opportunities that must also meet county and city-level guidelines results in a myriad of complications for founding entrepreneurs. The interviewees expressed growth as exceptionally constrained from a retail, consumer-distribution perspective. Because cities frequently restrict the real estate opportunities for each license type, allowing some licensed activities, not others, or none at all, the viable locations for cannabis businesses is restricted, thereby limiting the overall opportunity for market development.\n\nWhether this was good or ill depended on the perspective of the interviewee. Some business operators expressed satisfaction with this arrangement as they were already established, providing them the operational and experiential perch from which to expand operations. However, other operators expressed extreme frustration at zoning requirements that prevent business expansion.\_\_\_\n\nIn some cases the zoning requirements, on top of regulatory requirements, result in extensive business burdens that operators often characterized as comical. One interviewee explained his business’s need to obtain wholesale licensing in order to move his harvested product to a proper drying and curing area, the latter of which were located at a different facility due to local *municipal* requirements. (see “Market Distortions”)\_\n\n### Product Testing\n\nCannabinoid testing stood out as a consistent issue for Producers and Processors. While the costs are largely passed to consumers, business operators directly experienced them as direct business costs. Dual-licensed Producer-Processors express a feeling of a double- or triple-whammy of testing their inventory at harvest as well as post-processing. The intentions of state legislation are clearly aimed at providing consumer safety measures, an important benefit of an open market over an illicit, unregulated market. We cannot provide guidance on whether testing is excessive or whether testing methodologies should be modified.\n\nSome interviewees associate testing as merely another layer of tax. Participants who openly expressed this perspective typically accepted it as merely a cost of business, one borne by all participants. Under this perspective, the business operators expressed compliance as merely a throttle on the pace the business can operate at rather than conferring any tangible competitive disadvantages. Nonetheless, the pace of activity is a determinant in business growth, so operators often saw the business processes pre- and post-testing as critical areas for operational advantage.\_ In other words, operators know they are all facing the same regulatory requirements, so if they are to obtain any meaningful market advantage, it has to occur through operational excellence. Interviewees frequently stated this as based on their experience since the recreational market started, seeing the *non-professional* entrepreneurs folding due to a lack of understanding in the critical role process plays in their business’s success.\_\_\n\n### Cannabis Tracking Systems\n\nEach regulated market, varying by state, utilizes a \"Cannabis Tracking System\" (CTS). This CTS is a piece of software provided by a vendor for the purposes of tracking cannabis products from seed-sprouting to end consumer sales (\"seed to sale\"). There are a few prominent vendors, such as Metrc, LeafLogix and BioTrac.\n\nFrom the perspective of regulators, the CTS is the mechanism for monitoring market activity. It is a mechanism for maintaining an understanding of production volumes and end consumer purchases, with the end goal of moving cannabis consumption from an illicit to a regulated market. The CTS is merely a necessary tool for monitoring this objective.\_\_\n\nFrom the perspective of business operators, there is a begrudging understanding of the CTS's implicit need and use. However, many operators expressed consternation at the operational points at which the CTS comes into play. Each operator, without fail, recognized the CTS as an operational burden, though not as a direct hamper on growth itself.\n\nHiring is the status-quo panacea for CTS data-entry. Outside retail environments, software is not viewed as a viable solution to increasing operational efficiencies. This was a surprising insight to us authors. The reason for this perspective depends on the operator type.\n\nFor producers, software frequently acts as an additional layer of obligation that interferes with the actual growing. While there is software to help with the monitoring and optimization of growing conditions over time through intensive data collection, no producer participant expressed using software for these purposes. The existing required CTS for each state was sufficient for their needs. Producers were focused on growing, not data collection.\n\nWe cannot confirm, though our interviews provide enough insight to speculate, that part of the reluctance to embrace technology as an automation tool comes from the very background of most existing cannabis industry participants: non-technical fields. For example, prior to the legalization of cannabis production within a state, experienced growers were doing so in an opaque economy. These growers were optimizing plant yield and flower quality for decades like all good farmers for millennia before: carefully monitoring the conditions and making small changes to measure the output. When a state flips to a regulated recreational market, these same growers who have never had a use for software before are faced with the prospect of using the state's CTS or doubling-down and using the state CTS *and an additional piece of software* for optimizing data collection. The former is often the choice as there is no pressing need for advanced software when growth canopies are artificially enforced. The exception to this is likely found in only the largest of indoor growing operations. Our interviews unfortunately did not allow for a confirmation of this intuition.\n\nFor wholesale and distribution operations, ancillary software for business operations was consistently a no-go. Each interview participant expressed that all existing cannabis-focused wholesale software vendors either didn't consider their use cases (and so were not viable at all) or were inadequately equipped to deal with the volume or complexities of wholesale businesses. Much of the short-comings expressed related to state CTS obligations regarded manifest generation as well as tools for inventory auditing. The latter is focused on in \"Distribution Trouble.\" Other notable concerns from wholesalers were on the out-of-the-box tools for integrating with state CTS programs or managing rolling inventory audit processes and record reconciliation issues experienced with third-party vendors who integrated with state CTSs.\_\n\nFor dispensaries, there is a pressing need for software that interacts with or manages the Point of Sale. Because consumer transactions occur both at a higher rate than most non-retail license operations, and with a broader range of SKUs, there is a more clear business need for a POS system. We suspect that the higher maturity of POS systems generally reinforces the adoption of auxiliary software tools. This aligns well with our intuitions around a retail experience. Despite the adoption of POS and cannabis-specific inventory tools, our interviews indicate the existing software vendors focused on cannabis retail operations are *not* providing clear competitive advantages. The only standout market incumbent that was not also a state CTS provider was FlowHub.\n\nFrom the perspective of software, the industry appears *adequately* satisfied with existing CTSs despite highly consistent complaints around usability.\n\nRegarding state CTS software providers (Metrc, BioTrack, etc), there is a market distortion highlighted by state legislation: a state-created software monopoly. Because each state requires a CTS in order to meet its legislative mandate to track cannabinoid products from seed-to-sale, they require a centralized data store for on-going monitoring and auditing efforts. The state, through existing RFP processes, elects a single vendor for this purpose. As one may hypothesize from basic economic theory, a monopolistic entity has little market incentive to innovate. This results in a *minimally adequate product* -- the software and service provided by the state appointed CTS meets the base requirements for each state's legislative requirements and nothing more. Operators bear the burden of vendor-lock such that the provider (Metrc et al) have no economic incentive to improve their existing product, and the consumers (business operators) must use the product. This situation will likely remain the case until cannabis regulatory restrictions lessen extensively or policy updates such as interstate commerce require a more open software market.\n\n### Distribution Trouble\n\nFor wholesale and courier businesses, the most expensive compliance operation is related to Manifest generation. A manifest is a document detailing the inventory being transferred between any two licensed businesses. It includes the driver information, the time of departure and estimated time of arrival and often the *route* traveled by the driver. While state requirements vary, each state consistently requires the shipping manifest for any location-to-location cannabis movement. While operators in some states expressed the overhead for manifests was not too onerous, operators in Oregon expressed extreme frustration about Manifest requirements. Operators in Oregon explained that because shipping must be in order, with routes for all \"end of day\" deliveries reflected in the \"start of day\" deliveries, any alteration of route caused by a new order coming in prior to shipping, resulted in extensive human work to update the manifests. This is also a problem for operational optimization because delivery drivers cannot receive updated routes while in the field.\n\nThe example in Oregon was not a universally shared constraint; however, each logistics operator mentioned manifests as a salient issue. As with many compliance-constraints discussed thus far, *the solution to this problem was an employee hire*. Many logistics firms also address this problem through business-to-business relationships. Interviewees indicate cannabis is a people-relationship driven industry. One example of this relationship building was a focus on developing consistent cadences for delivery from producers (or processors/wholesalers) to dispensaries. This approach to consistency and reliability directly reduced costs for operators.\n\nMany businesses, be it traditional wholesale or courier-only, simply create order-by deadlines which dispensaries or processing facilities need to follow. This is a standard practice in most retail-vendor environments, implying that outside the need for manifest generation and strict business policies, there is little differentiating the cannabis industry from traditional wholesale participants. The most salient concern for wholesale operators was the prospect of growth long-term and *reliable* *suppliers*.\n"
