    subtitle: Cannabis Regulatory Impacts on Business Operations
    content: "### Abstract\n\nBy conducting one-on-one interviews with cannabis industry executives in a sample of five recreational states, we are able to obtain a qualitative understanding of the consequences of state regulatory compliance on operations and growth. Interviews included the full range of license types, from Producer to Retail, in order to understand the implications of compliance for each stage in the cannabinoid product lifecycle. To balance the perspective of industry interviewees, we included interviews with state regulators in Washington and Oregon.\n\nThe most salient of issues consistently communicated by business operators related to banking and access to commercial financing. The interviews further indicate the regulated cannabis market -- both in terms of product liquidity and inventory prices -- is distorted due to state regulatory policies.\_ We conclude our work with a summary of the trajectory of markets as anticipated by industry participants, followed by commentary on the implications from our interviews. We observe that compliance with state regulations is hampering growth and, most importantly, the supply-price efficiencies expected in open free markets.\n"

  - title: Research Objectives
    content: "Our objective was to seek a broad, industry-wide examination of cannabis participants because far too often states are treated independently. Indeed, the most accurate reports available on the cannabis industry are often published by state regulatory boards themselves in order to meet legislative mandates. These reports are therefore solely focused on a single state. Indeed, most state-produced research on the cannabis industry does not focus on the business consequences for operators due to regulations. Instead, state policy researchers focus on either macro-economic factors such as raw THC produced or canopy grown with future forecasts. In other instances, researchers focus on addressing public health or social perception changes.\_\n\nWhile a state-centric perspective is appropriate for many examinations due to the patchwork of legalized markets across the US, this technique fragments the potential of examining the meta-trends within the cannabis industry. This lack of focus on the economic and financial consequences presents a clear gap in current research.\_\n\nWithout exception, cannabinoid products are among the most heavily regulated and taxed consumer products available in the US. This implies that business owners and operators are experiencing real costs associated with compliance. What are they?\n\nWe attempt to answer this with a motivating interview question: \"How does compliance with state regulations impact business operations and growth?\"\n\n### Methods\n\nBecause each point in the lifecycle of a cannabinoid product (\"seed to sale\") is tracked by all states, we did not limit our examination to a particular license type. Instead, we sought the perspective of established businesses at each stage.\_\n\nIn order to obtain first-hand information from business operators, we conducted one-on-one interviews with established cannabinoid operators. These interviews were unsolicited -- we conducted direct outreach seeking individuals who were managing business operations and willing to participate in the research.\_ Of 100 businesses contacted, we obtained 12 partial interviews and 16 complete interviews. While our hope was for a minimum of 30 *completed* interviews, we felt the data collected thus far were still significant and worth sharing before any insights grew stale.\n\nBecause our examination sought to understand the trends and trajectories for markets, we attempted to select states at varying stages of maturity. Maturity in this context is tied to the development of the regulated market, rather than the illicit market ecosystem. Attempting to gauge the maturity of an unregulated market's ecosystem (production, distribution, consumption) would be a quixotic task as little data are available and market participants are not directly identifiable. While we concede that an existing illicit market likely contributes to the trajectory of a regulated market's development, this is an unknowable quantity. Moreover, the state's legal regulations directly shape the legalized consumer market's development as it is through the regulated market processes that direct retail activity is possible. In our opinion, the legislated regulations are strict enough to make the existence of the unregulated market's operational efficiency a moot point -- legal operators *cannot* function in a similar way as illicit operators, so it is a matter of comparing apples to robots.\_ What is *measurable* in this context is *the experience of the legal operator since inception*.\_\n\nWe view a state’s existing *medical* cannabis program in a similar light. That is, the transition effects from an existing Medical Cannabis program were excluded on the basis that the medical program existed in each state *prior* to recreational status, thereby acting as a *loose* control condition among all participating states. We cannot construct a laboratory with exactly controlled pre-recreational states, though we can evaluate the *recreational* status as similar enough to act as an acceptable control among the states.\_\_\n\nTo establish a baseline understanding of the nation-wide trends in cannabis at varying degrees of market maturity, we selected key markets for examination: CA, CO, OR, MA, WA.\n"

  - title: Top Compliance Impacts to Business Operations
    content: "The consistent theme regarding direct costs, be that cannabis product testing, plant tagging, harvest tracking, or simple CTS data entry, is that they are largely resolvable with an employee hire. This was a surprising finding as we speculated that operational demands would be considered heavy even in light of employee hires. While our objective was to find the direct consequences of compliance on operations, our interviews revealed that the *indirect effects of existing regulations were more salient for businesses* than the direct. The following sections summarizes these salient issues expressed by interviewees in order of relative salience to the interviewees.\n\n### Banking and Financing\n\nEach operator in some form brought up banking or commercial financing, without exception. This problem, originating exclusively on the federal level, remains the bugbear for the industry with multiple secondary consequences.\_\_\n\nWhile state regulators expressed a direct interest in attempting to help cannabis operators, there is only so much a state government can do in light of federal regulations regarding cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance. This is likely no surprise to any reader. As it stands, banking services for any cannabis related business are generally restricted to in-state credit unions. Banking services for multi-state operators (MSOs) remain exceptionally rare and reserved for the largest and well-funded enterprises, often publicly traded operations.\n\nDespite the status of banking, interviews with state regulators in WA and OR indicate *satisfaction with the trajectory of banking* penetration among cannabis operators. WA cited 99% of taxes collected come in the form of a check, a strong leading indication of business banking services. Operators, however, see the situation as expensive with monthly banking services a noticeable line-item, especially compared to the range of banking services offered to them versus traditional commercial banking options (cash deposits, transfers, payroll). This trend was not as noticeable regarding insurance costs, as no cannabis operators expressed insurance as onerous.\n\nBeyond expensive basic banking services, obtaining financing opportunities remains an extremely salient challenge for business operators, particularly due to the lack of acceptance of cannabis as an equal-risk operation to other legal manufacturing, wholesale or retail operations. Banks simply restrict or outright deny access to traditional commercial lending such as obtaining lines of credit against equipment or real estate. We explore potential consequences of this structure in our commentary, “Market Distortions.”\_\n\n### Brand Differentiation\n\nMultiple operators, from production to retail, expressed an interest in brand development. From their perspective, cannabis is competitive regardless of which segment of the industry one operates in and that long-term brand differentiation will be needed to sustain future growth. We summarize below, by operator type, the expressed obstacles to brand development.\_\n\nFor retailers, concerns focused on consumer access to products including how regulations impacted customer experience or inadvertently perpetuated negative social stigmas. An example of perpetuating social stigma is rules pertaining to product accessibility: cannabinoid products cannot be viewable from public spaces, resulting in boarded up windows, typically a sign of antisocial behavior. This later problem is tightly coupled to zoning restrictions (below), though is also impacted by state-mandated licencing constraints.\_\n\nIn the case of production operations, their ability to develop a deep customer relationship (\"brand\") is severely constrained by the total canopy of production. That is, a single grow operation which may feel it has a competitively advantaged product (\"flower\", “genetics”), cannot supply enough dispensaries to develop the penetration needed to build a consistent supply that can translate into a *Brand*. That is, the supply constraint prevents the retail penetration necessary for a consumer recognition of a grow-operation. As explored further in “Market Distortions” (below), the value of cannabinoid products in any form are directly tied to the artificial supply constraints imposed by canopy licensing limits. Licensing and premise requirements (security, facilities, etc) perpetuate the cost-skew.\n\nWere those canopy limits or facility constraints removed, the per-unit cost of a cannabinoid product would demonstrably drop. We speculate that while production operations would then be positioned *hypothetically* to expand operations sufficiently to develop consistent market penetration which *may* result in consumer brand awareness, we feel it is *more likely* that cannabis would rapidly come into alignment with other farming commodities: less branding on base products and more on refined or finished goods. In that scenario, the processing and edibles operators would be better positioned for long-term brand development, as would retail locations focused on a differentiated consumer experience, such as seen with Starbucks or McDonalds compared to generic coffee or burger operations.\n\nFor processing companies, the obstacles were generally restricted to typical product-differentiation needs: proper penetration into retail spaces and reliable supply lines. These are, in effect, issues regarding capitalization and operational scale. Regulatory compliance was not characterized as impactful on brand development.\_\_\n\nThe exception to this desire for brand development was with the Wholesale and Logistics licenses due to their B2B focus. However, multiple wholesale operators expressed their service differentiation as a close collaboration with producers and processors in developing *their* brands. The wholesale operators included in our interviews expressed prior experience in logistics that they leveraged into the cannabis trade. Many participants expressed this experience provided them the proper perspective on cannabis as a *commodity*, a perspective in the opinion of the interviewees that is not frequently shared by other license holders such as dispensaries and producers. Indeed, many of the wholesale operators expressed auxiliary business services focused within industry and operational consulting as a primary value proposition for producers and processors. In this way, the wholesalers frequently positioned themselves in our discussions as business partners for producers and processors in which all businesses’ success have a soft dependency on one another. That is, each company’s growth is intertwined with the others. Examples include a need for coordinating pricing, guidance on packaging and the maintenance of relationships with dispensaries.\_\_\_\n\n### Regulatory Delay\n\nOverarching many discussions, interviewees highlighted the delays their businesses experienced in navigating regulatory compliance. Be it in Colorado, Oregon or Massachusetts, participants were most impressed by the lengthy process initial set up required. Some participants were looking to expand but were hampered by the application and zoning requirements. In Oregon and Washington, applications for new cannaprenueres have been effectively turned off. Washington, at the time of writing, has no plans to lift the application mortuarium. Oregon only recently (April 2021) began re-evaluating applications which were submitted prior to a state legislative moratorium that went into effect in 2018. *Three years of delay*. These are only the largest, most salient of delays for operators.\_\n\nInterviewees also expressed frustration with local municipalities, particularly in the earliest days of recreational authorization. One interviewee explained the situation as a result of local governmental officials (city, county) who are navigating the new legislation on the state- and city-levels at the same time the entrepreneurs who are attempting to launch their businesses. This results in local officials being poorly equipped from an *experiential* level -- they simply do not know how to properly implement the state, count and city ordinances. That lack of domain experience directly impacts the entrepreneurs.\n\nClearly the *costs* to the business and entrepreneur due to regulatory delay are salient and quantifiable. In the case of a producer seeking to expand canopy, she applies for another license *after* securing the land, *after* designing and constructing regulation-compliance infrastructure (facilities, security, etc), and *after* establishing insurance, water rights and more. The cost of a three-year delay in this case is the cost of the land, property taxes, insurance for *three years*.\_\n\nInterviewees did not express a perspective that this situation would change, particularly in challenging states such as California. We believe this is among the most salient impacts on the development of the cannabis market as a whole and explore the consequences further in our commentary, “Market Distortions”.\n\n### Zoning\n\nDue to state legislative structuring, many local municipalities possess direct discretion over cannabis production, processing and retail within their jurisdictions. Likely also not a surprise for any reader, the interaction effects from state licensing opportunities that must also meet county and city-level guidelines results in a myriad of complications for founding entrepreneurs. The interviewees expressed growth as exceptionally constrained from a retail, consumer-distribution perspective. Because cities frequently restrict the real estate opportunities for each license type, allowing some licensed activities, not others, or none at all, the viable locations for cannabis businesses is restricted, thereby limiting the overall opportunity for market development.\n\nWhether this was good or ill depended on the perspective of the interviewee. Some business operators expressed satisfaction with this arrangement as they were already established, providing them the operational and experiential perch from which to expand operations. However, other operators expressed extreme frustration at zoning requirements that prevent business expansion.\_\_\_\n\nIn some cases the zoning requirements, on top of regulatory requirements, result in extensive business burdens that operators often characterized as comical. One interviewee explained his business’s need to obtain wholesale licensing in order to move his harvested product to a proper drying and curing area, the latter of which were located at a different facility due to local *municipal* requirements. (see “Market Distortions”)\_\n\n### Product Testing\n\nCannabinoid testing stood out as a consistent issue for Producers and Processors. While the costs are largely passed to consumers, business operators directly experienced them as direct business costs. Dual-licensed Producer-Processors express a feeling of a double- or triple-whammy of testing their inventory at harvest as well as post-processing. The intentions of state legislation are clearly aimed at providing consumer safety measures, an important benefit of an open market over an illicit, unregulated market. We cannot provide guidance on whether testing is excessive or whether testing methodologies should be modified.\n\nSome interviewees associate testing as merely another layer of tax. Participants who openly expressed this perspective typically accepted it as merely a cost of business, one borne by all participants. Under this perspective, the business operators expressed compliance as merely a throttle on the pace the business can operate at rather than conferring any tangible competitive disadvantages. Nonetheless, the pace of activity is a determinant in business growth, so operators often saw the business processes pre- and post-testing as critical areas for operational advantage.\_ In other words, operators know they are all facing the same regulatory requirements, so if they are to obtain any meaningful market advantage, it has to occur through operational excellence. Interviewees frequently stated this as based on their experience since the recreational market started, seeing the *non-professional* entrepreneurs folding due to a lack of understanding in the critical role process plays in their business’s success.\_\_\n\n### Cannabis Tracking Systems\n\nEach regulated market, varying by state, utilizes a \"Cannabis Tracking System\" (CTS). This CTS is a piece of software provided by a vendor for the purposes of tracking cannabis products from seed-sprouting to end consumer sales (\"seed to sale\"). There are a few prominent vendors, such as Metrc, LeafLogix and BioTrac.\n\nFrom the perspective of regulators, the CTS is the mechanism for monitoring market activity. It is a mechanism for maintaining an understanding of production volumes and end consumer purchases, with the end goal of moving cannabis consumption from an illicit to a regulated market. The CTS is merely a necessary tool for monitoring this objective.\_\_\n\nFrom the perspective of business operators, there is a begrudging understanding of the CTS's implicit need and use. However, many operators expressed consternation at the operational points at which the CTS comes into play. Each operator, without fail, recognized the CTS as an operational burden, though not as a direct hamper on growth itself.\n\nHiring is the status-quo panacea for CTS data-entry. Outside retail environments, software is not viewed as a viable solution to increasing operational efficiencies. This was a surprising insight to us authors. The reason for this perspective depends on the operator type.\n\nFor producers, software frequently acts as an additional layer of obligation that interferes with the actual growing. While there is software to help with the monitoring and optimization of growing conditions over time through intensive data collection, no producer participant expressed using software for these purposes. The existing required CTS for each state was sufficient for their needs. Producers were focused on growing, not data collection.\n\nWe cannot confirm, though our interviews provide enough insight to speculate, that part of the reluctance to embrace technology as an automation tool comes from the very background of most existing cannabis industry participants: non-technical fields. For example, prior to the legalization of cannabis production within a state, experienced growers were doing so in an opaque economy. These growers were optimizing plant yield and flower quality for decades like all good farmers for millennia before: carefully monitoring the conditions and making small changes to measure the output. When a state flips to a regulated recreational market, these same growers who have never had a use for software before are faced with the prospect of using the state's CTS or doubling-down and using the state CTS *and an additional piece of software* for optimizing data collection. The former is often the choice as there is no pressing need for advanced software when growth canopies are artificially enforced. The exception to this is likely found in only the largest of indoor growing operations. Our interviews unfortunately did not allow for a confirmation of this intuition.\n\nFor wholesale and distribution operations, ancillary software for business operations was consistently a no-go. Each interview participant expressed that all existing cannabis-focused wholesale software vendors either didn't consider their use cases (and so were not viable at all) or were inadequately equipped to deal with the volume or complexities of wholesale businesses. Much of the short-comings expressed related to state CTS obligations regarded manifest generation as well as tools for inventory auditing. The latter is focused on in \"Distribution Trouble.\" Other notable concerns from wholesalers were on the out-of-the-box tools for integrating with state CTS programs or managing rolling inventory audit processes and record reconciliation issues experienced with third-party vendors who integrated with state CTSs.\_\n\nFor dispensaries, there is a pressing need for software that interacts with or manages the Point of Sale. Because consumer transactions occur both at a higher rate than most non-retail license operations, and with a broader range of SKUs, there is a more clear business need for a POS system. We suspect that the higher maturity of POS systems generally reinforces the adoption of auxiliary software tools. This aligns well with our intuitions around a retail experience. Despite the adoption of POS and cannabis-specific inventory tools, our interviews indicate the existing software vendors focused on cannabis retail operations are *not* providing clear competitive advantages. The only standout market incumbent that was not also a state CTS provider was FlowHub.\n\nFrom the perspective of software, the industry appears *adequately* satisfied with existing CTSs despite highly consistent complaints around usability.\n\nRegarding state CTS software providers (Metrc, BioTrack, etc), there is a market distortion highlighted by state legislation: a state-created software monopoly. Because each state requires a CTS in order to meet its legislative mandate to track cannabinoid products from seed-to-sale, they require a centralized data store for on-going monitoring and auditing efforts. The state, through existing RFP processes, elects a single vendor for this purpose. As one may hypothesize from basic economic theory, a monopolistic entity has little market incentive to innovate. This results in a *minimally adequate product* -- the software and service provided by the state appointed CTS meets the base requirements for each state's legislative requirements and nothing more. Operators bear the burden of vendor-lock such that the provider (Metrc et al) have no economic incentive to improve their existing product, and the consumers (business operators) must use the product. This situation will likely remain the case until cannabis regulatory restrictions lessen extensively or policy updates such as interstate commerce require a more open software market.\n\n### Distribution Trouble\n\nFor wholesale and courier businesses, the most expensive compliance operation is related to Manifest generation. A manifest is a document detailing the inventory being transferred between any two licensed businesses. It includes the driver information, the time of departure and estimated time of arrival and often the *route* traveled by the driver. While state requirements vary, each state consistently requires the shipping manifest for any location-to-location cannabis movement. While operators in some states expressed the overhead for manifests was not too onerous, operators in Oregon expressed extreme frustration about Manifest requirements. Operators in Oregon explained that because shipping must be in order, with routes for all \"end of day\" deliveries reflected in the \"start of day\" deliveries, any alteration of route caused by a new order coming in prior to shipping, resulted in extensive human work to update the manifests. This is also a problem for operational optimization because delivery drivers cannot receive updated routes while in the field.\n\nThe example in Oregon was not a universally shared constraint; however, each logistics operator mentioned manifests as a salient issue. As with many compliance-constraints discussed thus far, *the solution to this problem was an employee hire*. Many logistics firms also address this problem through business-to-business relationships. Interviewees indicate cannabis is a people-relationship driven industry. One example of this relationship building was a focus on developing consistent cadences for delivery from producers (or processors/wholesalers) to dispensaries. This approach to consistency and reliability directly reduced costs for operators.\n\nMany businesses, be it traditional wholesale or courier-only, simply create order-by deadlines which dispensaries or processing facilities need to follow. This is a standard practice in most retail-vendor environments, implying that outside the need for manifest generation and strict business policies, there is little differentiating the cannabis industry from traditional wholesale participants. The most salient concern for wholesale operators was the prospect of growth long-term and *reliable* *suppliers*.\n"

  - title: Anticipated Market Developments
    content: "The following section provides a breakdown of the top three most anticipated developments as expressed by the interviewees. Where appropriate we provide a brief comment on the barriers to that development and a rough estimate on its feasibility given current legislation and public sentiment.\_\_\n\n### Banking\n\nMany operators are optimistic legislation will change at the federal level. Many expressed confidence that it can only be a matter of time before political pressure from industry actors will force federal guidance to mitigate the risk to financial institutions. For example, wholesale operators as well as producers mentioned the H.R. 1996 (\"SAFE Banking Act\") as potentially more likely under a Biden/Democrat led legislative body, though the current impasse on the Senate level clearly makes this still an outside possibility. Further, the operators believe that pressure will come from a social equity standpoint because current financing options that are available carry rates characterized as \"cutthroat\" and \"loan shark\".\n\nIf one objective of the legalization effort is to repair social damage created in the \"War on Drugs,\" then creating an environment in which former social victims (cannabis industry participants or illicit market consumers) would be authorized to access the market but at the risk of extreme debt burdens is self-defeating. As expressed by the interviewees, one mechanism to alleviate this problem is to authorize banking opportunities for legally regulated cannabis businesses such that basic commercial lending from established FDIC banks becomes available. In this vein, interviewees are envisioning existing proposals such as the SAFE Banking Act as an example, often cited by name. Interviewees frequently expressed dismay at the current state and anticipate major banking and finance reform on the three- to five year horizon.\_\_\n\n### Interstate Trade\n\nA surprising insight for us authors was how focused many interviewees were on the prospect of interstate commerce. Discussions with every license type frequently lead to interstate trade. One interviewee characterized the situation by stating that interstate commerce is already occurring for cannabis products, including international export. It simply occurs in an unregulated fashion. One state regulator confirmed the continued existence of an illicit market but said that 90% or more is intended for out-of-state export. This means that all market participants see interstate trade as a given. And, moreover, from the perspective of interviewees, interstate trade is a natural progression in the development of the *regulated* cannabis industry.\_\n\nRegardless of license type, multiple business operators expressed seeing interstate trade opportunities as *more tangible than rectifying banking regulations*. This may be a reflection of the optimism for the business owners to exploit higher-priced markets to achieve personal growth goals or to liquidate a \\[perpetual] oversupply than actually substantiated regulatory factors for their belief. We characterise it in this way because of the matter-of-fact manner in which interstate trade emerged in discussions.\_ In either case, the operators were keen to understand what *other* state operators and regulators were thinking with regards to trade.\n\nWithout overly digressing, it is worth noting the tremendous barrier to interstate trade. The current obvious elephant is federal restrictions on interstate transport due to the controlled substance scheduling and interstate highway restrictions. However, that is a seemingly simple change that would still largely result in a state-driven restriction on interstate trade. Because the entire structure of a state's domestic cannabis production and sales engine requires a constrained market, it is necessary to *maintain* tight supply controls to *maintain consistent tax revenue*. We explore this in more detail in our commentary, “Market Distortions.”\_\n\nIn either case, these market *desires* for interstate trade all occur in the backdrop of a regulated market with state tracking. Interstate commerce presumes these systems can properly integrate with other state tracking. Interviews, both with operators and regulators, indicate that current state software and data infrastructures are not equipped to manage a transition to interstate commerce. We authors expect lengthy delays with extensive litigation between state bodies vis-a-vis tax revenue remittance and reconciliation and CTS integration.\_\n\n### Commodities Markets\n\nWhile only a couple interviewees directly discussed future markets in terms of existing commodities markets, the theme of interstate commerce implied a more consistent market for exchange is needed. Some operators felt that the \"real money\" was going to be made through commodities markets, others felt there was simply a need for a consistent process for market liquidity -- meaning, a need for a contract based exchange for clearing cannabis inventory, be that on the producer-side or post-processing. For the unfamiliar reader, contractual clearing involves the creation of a contracted exchange rate for a commodity. These contracts are often referred to as ‘futures.’ For example, a producer agreeing to sell five pounds of cannabis for $1500 per pound on February 15, 2022 would represent a *future* purchase agreement.\_ If you’ve ever heard of the price of pork bellies or wheat, marketplaces for these contracts are utilized to report those prices.\_\n\nAs it stands, one major barrier to this is the rapid increase in available strains. While outside the scope of our work, a cursory glance at available products shows hundreds of available strains. Moreover, grow conditions vary site-by-site, producing a greater variance in underlying commodity quality than one would see in other markets such as tobacco, milk or even crude. Without an industry adopted standard for grading cannabinoid products, any market based exchange will face extreme challenges in honoring contracted product quality. It does not seem likely the states will provide this guidance, though they do possess much of the industry-wide data that could make cannabinoid product grading feasible. Among industry participants, the lab providers seem best positioned to capture this market opportunity.\n\nAnother primary obstacle to a commodities market is interstate trade itself. If that barrier is not alleviated, then the best market participants can expect with regards a commodities market is the product batch-level services currently provided on a state-level, typified by providers like LeafLink. For readers unfamiliar with LeafLink, they are a subscription-based marketplace in which producers (and wholesalers or processors) may list their bulk products for purchase by dispensaries. It was beyond the scope of our research to conduct an in-depth analysis of LeafLink. Nonetheless, when LeafLink did come up as an option for market liquidity, it was seen as the sales mechanism of last resort, with on-going established relationships the primarily preferred mechanism for vendor relations.\n"

  - title: Concluding Comments
    content: "What becomes transparent from discussions with business operators is that current state regulatory practices *are* hampering growth, though not those initially hypothesized by us researchers. To wit, while regulatory compliance does result in higher staffing needs, higher base costs of business (from banking to security) and higher capital requirements (proper liquidity), our interviewed business operators largely transfer these costs to consumers. They may express *frustration* with the high costs of business but ultimately pass those costs onto their consumers.\_\n\nThere is a parallel cost that is implied by our interviews: *early* market entrants avoid *late* market costs.\_ We refer to this phenomenon as a *market distortion* and explore this topic, in our concluding comments, as a set of *observations only*. Our hope is future research may illuminate the validity of these observations. In short we ask, both directly through written, legislative restrictions and indirectly through the policy decisions originating from the executive branch, are state regulations perturbing market development?\n\n### Market Distortions\n\nBecause of the variance in the location and time in which recreational markets are authorized within the US, we are able to observe market development in a fairly controlled fashion. Due to state and federal legislation barring interstate commerce, each market acts independently from all other markets. This environment creates an exceptionally rare opportunity to study the development of a consumer market as most products are nationally, if not globally, broadcast simultaneously. This effectively results in an increased observable signal from the controlled, *captive* recreational cannabis market. While there are important distinctions in each state's individual implementation of the regulated markets, particularly regarding the license types available and the business activities authorized by those licenses, these differences largely do not impact consumer purchasing experiences because across all states the Retail licenses is the only authorized license type to interact directly with customers.\_\n\nFrom our perspective, most markets appear to experience similar problems over time regardless of legislative structure: a consistent multi-year increase in the supply of cannabinoid products outstripping demand, which is itself bottlenecked by retail dispensary locations. In some cases, such as in California, the regional and municipal governmental bodies generate a very salient impact on the development of these markets *because* *local municipal governments may outright ban recreational cannabis businesses*. Or, in the less pernicious form, to restrict the range of cannabis business permitted such that only small corridors of activity are possible. By making these zoning requirements on the local level, coupled with the state-level application mandates and issuance controls, the cannabis industry is hamstrung in its development. Regardless of the state in question, in our opinion, there is no other conclusion to make than that the cannabis industry does not operate as a free-market. State regulators, by legislative mandate, *directly manage* the supply and liquidity of each state’s cannabis market in a centralized, command economy manner.\n\nAs relates to our research, interviewees effectively communicated a white-knuckled grip on the business trying to steer multi-year market fluctuations in prices related to rapid supply changes. Operators in Oregon, for example, expressed a keen awareness of seasonality effects due to outdoor canopy harvests. Moreover, most participants expressed long-term concerns about supply and the trajectory of wholesale prices, all of which directly impact the viability of cannabis businesses at large. Interviews generally implied a strong sensitivity to future state regulation policies that may adversely hamper growth, on top of the current issues manifested through existing policies.\_\n\nIn our opinion it is key to understand that the strict control on the volume of cannabinoid products produced is *precisely* the mechanism states utilize to stabilize predictable tax collection from cannabinoid product sales. Without the severe restrictions on production via canopy and zoning requirements, and to a lesser extent retail sales locations, the base price for cannabis products would continue to fall, despite continued increases in consumer demand. Falling end-consumer prices directly impacts the expected tax revenues, save an increase in tax rates which are already at historic highs for any commodity category.\_\n\nTaking a step back, we see the historic illegality of cannabis is what kept its production to low levels, with dispersed growers hiding via small-batch production. That small-scale, hidden production process resulted in high prices. There is nothing inherently difficult about cannabis as a *crop* that justifies prices at current levels, save the constrained supply. The legalization of the product is then caught in an economic conundrum which invariably forces states to maintain domestic production and avoid interstate commerce--an influx of supply from a low-cost production state such as OR, CA or WA, could dramatically impact end-consumer prices and existing in-state producers. While states attempt to stave off the effects of economics by manipulating license issuance, their research confirms basic economic principles of supply-demand price elasticity such that lower consumer prices resulted in higher consumption as measured by purchase volume.\_\n\nThus, when we evaluate our forward-looking statements regarding interstate trade, we see such a change requires a reconciliation of tax revenue, likely in the form of tariffs. Through existing state legislation, the states created a captive market, both in production and retail, that now *requires that captive market status to be maintained indefinitely or risk dramatic market shocks in price*. The state’s objective in a reconciliation scheme, therefore, is to eliminate the advantages of interstate commerce. With the cannabis industry not only providing large tax windfalls but also employing thousands of people per state, such a change-risk from interstate commerce becomes more and more untenable due to market entrenchment.\_\n\nThis is of course all within the context of an on-going illicit market that persists in each state we evaluated. The states need to induce market players to *switch* from the illicit market (or put them “out of business”) by creating an economic opportunity for entrepreneurs while *also* maintaining high, predictable tax revenue. This is effectively a walking contradiction. If elimination of the illicit market were the goal, the price of cannabinoid products should fall in alignment with other similar crop products such as tobacco, rather than utilizing a benchmark comparison between regulated and unregulated “bulk cannabis” to measure success. The benchmark for *eliminating* an illegal activity cannot be *matching the price* for consumers, there has to be an inducement for full switch. That means *lower-than-illicit-market* prices.\_\n\nFrom zoning to delays in license issuance to outright mortuariums on licensure (Oregon, Washington), state regulators are managing the economy through *direct and indirect policy* decisions.\_ What remains abundantly clear, in the opinion of the authors, is that existing cannabis legislation lacks an accounting of the secondary effects that result from the bills themselves. Policy makers and regulators, we suspect, are fully aware of these problems at least in outline.\_ In either case, the state bills create an environment in which market distortions should be expected. Worse yet, there appears to be little public or legislative will for rectifying this situation in any near-term capacity, be that from naivety or status-quo satisfaction. As long as states are able to maintain relatively high tax-revenue projections and the well-positioned businesses continue to profit from the existing arrangements, there will likely be no change. Cannabis consumers pay the ultimate cost for this arrangement, namely in the form of inflated prices. Incentivized by tax revenue needs exacerbated by decades of state budget shortfalls and the 2020 Covid pandemic, we fully expect the economic distortions will persist for another decade or longer.\n\n### Future Work\n\nIn addition to the economic market development consequences explored above, there is a clear gap in research connecting meta-trends emerging in the regulated US cannabis market, particularly as pertains to the financial and economic impacts of individual state policies.\_ A framework for future examinations should attempt to focus on the interstate trends within three general domains: (1) commodity price trends ; (2) social equity and entrepreneurial access \\[due to licensing and financing access]; (3) public and social trends as pertains to use of cannabinoid products and mental health.\_ An ideal framework would be capable of accommodating and indeed integrating both a qualitative assessment as conducted here as well as quantitative inputs such as business performance metrics. While privacy constraints may make this later need more difficult to obtain, we believe an accounting that aligns actual operational performance with participant perspectives will be particularly enlightening.\_\n\nThere is also a pressing need to understand the obstacles new and *pending* market entrants are experiencing, particularly in the context of social equity. As explored in our comments above, we feel the well-heeled private citizens are the ones benefiting most from the recreational cannabis market, while the socio-economically disadvantaged are paying a higher “market entry fee” simply because the time to capitalization was higher, delaying the entrepreneur's ability to enter the market.\_ \n"
