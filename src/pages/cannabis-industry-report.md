      ### Abstract


      By conducting one-on-one interviews with cannabis industry executives in a
      sample of five recreational states, we are able to obtain a qualitative
      understanding of the consequences of state regulatory compliance on
      operations and growth. Interviews included the full range of license
      types, from Producer to Retail, in order to understand the implications of
      compliance for each stage in the cannabinoid product lifecycle. To balance
      the perspective of industry interviewees, we included interviews with
      state regulators in Washington and Oregon.
