    subtitle: Cannabis Regulatory Impacts on Business Operations
    content: "### Abstract\n\nBy conducting one-on-one interviews with cannabis industry executives in a sample of five recreational states, we are able to obtain a qualitative understanding of the consequences of state regulatory compliance on operations and growth. Interviews included the full range of license types, from Producer to Retail, in order to understand the implications of compliance for each stage in the cannabinoid product lifecycle. To balance the perspective of industry interviewees, we included interviews with state regulators in Washington and Oregon.\n\nThe most salient of issues consistently communicated by business operators related to banking and access to commercial financing. The interviews further indicate the regulated cannabis market -- both in terms of product liquidity and inventory prices -- is distorted due to state regulatory policies.\_ We conclude our work with a summary of the trajectory of markets as anticipated by industry participants, followed by commentary on the implications from our interviews. We observe that compliance with state regulations is hampering growth and, most importantly, the supply-price efficiencies expected in open free markets.\n"

      - title: Banking and Financing
        content: "Each operator in some form brought up banking or commercial financing, without exception. This problem, originating exclusively on the federal level, remains the bugbear for the industry with multiple secondary consequences.\_\_\n\n\nWhile state regulators expressed a direct interest in attempting to help cannabis operators, there is only so much a state government can do in light of federal regulations regarding cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance. This is likely no surprise to any reader. As it stands, banking services for any cannabis related business are generally restricted to in-state credit unions. Banking services for multi-state operators (MSOs) remain exceptionally rare and reserved for the largest and well-funded enterprises, often publicly traded operations.\n\nDespite the status of banking, interviews with state regulators in WA and OR indicate *satisfaction with the trajectory of banking* penetration among cannabis operators. WA cited 99% of taxes collected come in the form of a check, a strong leading indication of business banking services. Operators, however, see the situation as expensive with monthly banking services a noticeable line-item, especially compared to the range of banking services offered to them versus traditional commercial banking options (cash deposits, transfers, payroll). This trend was not as noticable regarding insurance costs, as no cannabis operators expressed insurance as onerous.\n\nBeyond expensive basic banking services, obtaining financing opportunities remains an extremely salient challenge for business operators, particularly due to the lack of acceptance of cannabis as an equal-risk operation to other legal manufacturing, wholesale or retail operations. Banks simply restrict or outright deny access to traditional commercial lending such as obtaining lines of credit against equipment or real estate. We explore potential consequences of this structure in our commentary, “Market Distortions.” \n"
