## From Seed to Sale, Cannabis Regulatory Impacts on Business Operations

By conducting one-on-one interviews with cannabis industry executives in a sample of five recreational states, we are able to obtain a qualitative understanding of the consequences of state regulatory compliance on operations and growth. Interviews included the full range of license types, from Producer to Retail, in order to understand the implications of compliance for each stage in the cannabinoid product lifecycle. To balance the perspective of industry interviewees, we included interviews with state regulators in Washington and Oregon.

**The most salient of issues consistently communicated by business operators related to banking and access to commercial financing.** The interviews further indicate the regulated cannabis market -- both in terms of product liquidity and inventory prices -- is distorted due to state regulatory policies.Â  We conclude our work with a summary of the trajectory of markets as anticipated by industry participants, followed by commentary on the implications from our interviews. We observe that compliance with state regulations is hampering growth and, most importantly, the supply-price efficiencies expected in open free markets.
