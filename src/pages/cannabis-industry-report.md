    subtitle: Cannabis Regulatory Impacts on Business Operations
    content: "### Abstract\n\nBy conducting one-on-one interviews with cannabis industry executives in a sample of five recreational states, we are able to obtain a qualitative understanding of the consequences of state regulatory compliance on operations and growth. Interviews included the full range of license types, from Producer to Retail, in order to understand the implications of compliance for each stage in the cannabinoid product lifecycle. To balance the perspective of industry interviewees, we included interviews with state regulators in Washington and Oregon.\n\nThe most salient of issues consistently communicated by business operators related to banking and access to commercial financing. The interviews further indicate the regulated cannabis market -- both in terms of product liquidity and inventory prices -- is distorted due to state regulatory policies.\_ We conclude our work with a summary of the trajectory of markets as anticipated by industry participants, followed by commentary on the implications from our interviews. We observe that compliance with state regulations is hampering growth and, most importantly, the supply-price efficiencies expected in open free markets.\n"

  - title: Research Objectives
    content: "Our objective was to seek a broad, industry-wide examination of cannabis participants because far too often states are treated independently. Indeed, the most accurate reports available on the cannabis industry are often published by state regulatory boards themselves in order to meet legislative mandates. These reports are therefore solely focused on a single state. Indeed, most state-produced research on the cannabis industry does not focus on the business consequences for operators due to regulations. Instead, state policy researchers focus on either macro-economic factors such as raw THC produced or canopy grown with future forecasts. In other instances, researchers focus on addressing public health or social perception changes.\_\n\nWhile a state-centric perspective is appropriate for many examinations due to the patchwork of legalized markets across the US, this technique fragments the potential of examining the meta-trends within the cannabis industry. This lack of focus on the economic and financial consequences presents a clear gap in current research.\_\n\nWithout exception, cannabinoid products are among the most heavily regulated and taxed consumer products available in the US. This implies that business owners and operators are experiencing real costs associated with compliance. What are they?\n\nWe attempt to answer this with a motivating interview question: \"How does compliance with state regulations impact business operations and growth?\"\n\n## Methods\n\nBecause each point in the lifecycle of a cannabinoid product (\"seed to sale\") is tracked by all states, we did not limit our examination to a particular license type. Instead, we sought the perspective of established businesses at each stage.\_\n\nIn order to obtain first-hand information from business operators, we conducted one-on-one interviews with established cannabinoid operators. These interviews were unsolicited -- we conducted direct outreach seeking individuals who were managing business operations and willing to participate in the research.\_ Of 100 businesses contacted, we obtained 12 partial interviews and 16 complete interviews. While our hope was for a minimum of 30 *completed* interviews, we felt the data collected thus far were still significant and worth sharing before any insights grew stale.\n\nBecause our examination sought to understand the trends and trajectories for markets, we attempted to select states at varying stages of maturity. Maturity in this context is tied to the development of the regulated market, rather than the illicit market ecosystem. Attempting to gauge the maturity of an unregulated market's ecosystem (production, distribution, consumption) would be a quixotic task as little data are available and market participants are not directly identifiable. While we concede that an existing illicit market likely contributes to the trajectory of a regulated market's development, this is an unknowable quantity. Moreover, the state's legal regulations directly shape the legalized consumer market's development as it is through the regulated market processes that direct retail activity is possible. In our opinion, the legislated regulations are strict enough to make the existence of the unregulated market's operational efficiency a moot point -- legal operators *cannot* function in a similar way as illicit operators, so it is a matter of comparing apples to robots.\_ What is *measurable* in this context is *the experience of the legal operator since inception*.\_\n\nWe view a stateâ€™s existing *medical* cannabis program in a similar light. That is, the transition effects from an existing Medical Cannabis program were excluded on the basis that the medical program existed in each state *prior* to recreational status, thereby acting as a *loose* control condition among all participating states. We cannot construct a laboratory with exactly controlled pre-recreational states, though we can evaluate the *recreational* status as similar enough to act as an acceptable control among the states.\_\_\n\nTo establish a baseline understanding of the nation-wide trends in cannabis at varying degrees of market maturity, we selected key markets for examination: CA, CO, OR, MA, WA.\n"
